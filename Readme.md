# Prompt Archive

---

The sole motivation for this project is that I wanted to create a website that could hold up all the prompts I see throughtout the day and make it easier for me to access those prompts from anywhere. I will add a database to this when I start earning but for now this gets the job done. Feel free to fork the repo and use it as you like. Also give suggestions for this project.
